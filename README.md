### .apiremove.sh
.apiremove.sh will prevent accidental exposure of API keys on GitHub by removing API keys before committing your changes, while allowing your API keys in your local files to remain intact.

    apiremoveall "commit message"

This command changes *all* files with API keys in them and commits them to GitHub with the replaced <YOUR-API-KEY> filler text, then returns the original API key to your local file. 


    apiremovefile filename "commit message"

This command is similar to apiremoveall, but the script only applies the changes for one file. 

    Example format (OpenWeatherAPI): 
    var apiKey = "asdf230948902890382308490" 
    url = URL(string: String("http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?
    APPID=\(apiKey)&lat=\(123)&lon=\(123)"))

Your API key, "asdf230948902890382308490," would be replaced with `<YOUR-API-KEY>`. The script will scan for this line, so embed this variable into request where you would normally put the API key. 

##### Improvements:
* censor more than just API keys
* make syntax less API-oriented (if censoring more than just API keys)


### .mysql-simple-output.sh

Easy logging into MySQL Command Line Client from any location. 

    login <your-password>

or because writing your password on terminal is relatively unsafe, you can just use ```login``` and it will prompt you to enter your password. 

##### Improvements
* finish the unfinished function to log output more easily

### .debugcleaner.sh
For those whomst'd debug their code using print statements, .debugcleaner.sh will remove the history of your struggles, making published code clear of all debugging statements and preparing it for production. 


    debugcleaner filename

This function wipes all debugging statements from your code. But be warned, this modifies the original file.

##### Improvements:
* add support for more languages
* git commit code in "cleaned" state, but allow local files to keep debugging statements
* clear the blank lines produced by the delete

### .gosetup.sh
This script provides a fast way to set up golang. Simply cd to the directory where you want all your go projects to be container, then run ```gosetup``` in Terminal and enjoy. 

### INSTALLATION: 

As you would install any other terminal script, go to terminal and type the following command: 

    open ~/.bash_profile


This opens the file that will contain all the scripts with the functions that can be run by terminal. On some systems, the file may be called ~/.profile, so if that does not work then try ```open ~/.profile``` instead. 
```
source "<YOUR PATH NAME>"
```
Replace ```<YOUR PATH NAME>``` with the path the file with the script, then restart terminal. The script should then be ready to use.
